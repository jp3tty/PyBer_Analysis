# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
PyBer, a rideshare company, needed visualization to showcase their average fare versus the total number of rides split by the trips location (urban, suburban, or rural). Data from 2019 is used for this analysis and will compare the total fares, total rides, and total drivers to capture PyBer's 2019 status and guide PyBer's business decisions on where resources and support are needed.

## Results

PyBer's data was captured with city information (Urban, Suburban, and Rural), fare amount, and driver ID.

Below the box plots show the statistical distribution for the drivers for every setting. The urban and rural locations show normal distributions but the suburban setting have a negative skewed which will lets us know that some of these drivers are gathering less fares than other drivers.
